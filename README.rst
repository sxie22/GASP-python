GASP is a genetic algorithm for structure and phase prediction written in Python and interfaced to GULP_, LAMMPS_ and VASP_. It can search for the structures of clusters, 2D materials, wires, and bulk materials and do both fixed-composition and phase diagram searches.

Getting GASP
============
It is easiest to install GASP and all its dependencies into a conda_ environment. GASP makes extensive use of pymatgen_, an open source Python library for materials analysis, and these instructions have been adapted from pymatgen. More details on installing pymatgen can be found at http://pymatgen.org/installation.html.

If pymatgen is already installed, steps 1-3 may be skipped.

.. _conda: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/index.html
.. _pymatgen: http://pymatgen.org/

1. Install conda
----------------

Many computing clusters have Anaconda installed which shall be loaded as -

    module load conda

or in some clusters it is

    module load python

Check if conda is loaded by

    conda info --envs

which shows all conda environments (if conda is loaded successfully).

If conda command not found, download and install the latest version of conda for your operating system from http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html. Although GASP is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.6, pymatgen recommends using Python >=3.6.

For Windows, make sure you have the Miniconda3 installer, and simply double-click the .exe file.

For Mac or Linux, run the bash script::

    # if Mac
    bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

    # if Linux
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

The installer will ask you to approve the terms of the license and then tell you where the installation will be located. The default location is fine, so press Enter. Finally, the installer will ask if you would like it to add the install location to your PATH by prepending a line to your .bash_profile (for Mac) or .bashrc (for Linux) file. Type 'yes' and press Enter.

After completing the installation, create a new terminal in order for the environment variables added by conda to be loaded.


2. Create a conda environment
-----------------------------

To create a new conda environment named 'my_gasp', type::

    conda create --name my_gasp python=3.7

When conda asks you::

    proceed ([y]/n)?

Type 'y' and press Enter.

Now activate the environment so that packages can be installed into it::

    # if Mac or Linux
    source activate my_gasp

    # if Windows
    activate my_gasp


3. Install pymatgen and its dependencies
----------------------------------------

pymatgen requires using the gcc compiler. To do so, type::

    export CC=gcc

Install pymatgen, which also installs other required dependencies - numpy, scipy, matplotlib with pip::

    pip install pymatgen

Install dask and dask_jobqueue with conda::

    conda install -c conda-forge dask dask-jobqueue

When searching for clusters and wires, GASP uses features of pymatgen that depend on openbabel. So if you plan to use GASP to search for clusters or wires, install openbabel in your conda environment (recommended)::

   conda install -c openbabel openbabel

For Mac, an additional step is needed in order to use the scripts included with GASP for making plots. These scripts depend on the matplotlib_ library, which requires a framework build of Python to run properly on Mac OS X. However, a regular Python build comes with conda by default. To install a framework build in your conda environment, type::

    conda install python.app

See the 'Visualizing output' section of the the `usage file`_ for more information on making plots.

4. Install GASP-python
----------------------

Clone the repository from github::

    git clone https://github.com/henniggroup/GASP-python.git

Move into the 'GASP-python' directory and run the setup.py script::

    cd GASP-python
    python setup.py develop
